Theory of Computer Games, NTU

Homework #2

Due date: 2:20pm, December 24, 2015.

Description:
Write a program that plays 9*9 Go with Monte-Carlo game tree search
techniques. The purpose of this homework is to ask you to master the
basic techniques of Monte-Carlo tree search, not to test your efforts in
designing GUI.

Rules for Special 9*9 Go:
1. Black plays first.
2. String without liberty is removed.
3. The rule of Ko: You cannot place a stone and result in a previous position.
after the removing of strings without liberty.
That is, you cannot create a loop.
4. You can pass, but cannot play a suicide ply.
5. You can place a stone in a place without liberty if
as a result you can capture opponent's stones.
6. When both players pass in consecutive plys, the game ends.
7. The one with more stones and eyes wins at the end of the game.
8. When calculating the final score, the black side, namely the
first player, has a penalty of 7 stones, which is set by what is called Komi.
9. Each ply must be finished in 10 seconds.

Solution Package:
1. Source Code
2. Report
   Explain the techniques you implemented and the coefficients you picked.
   Explain how they are picked.
3. Need to implement at least UCB, UCT and progressive pruning.
   The rest are bonus.

Grading policy:
1. coding of needed functions +
can play a complete game with the given default template
2. documentation
3. Bonus: win rate againt all other students
4. Bonus: win rate againt the benchmark
